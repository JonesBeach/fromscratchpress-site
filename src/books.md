    <h3>A workplace novella told with friendship, absurdity, and drip coffee.</h3>
    <p>A man quits his job, and then convinces his two best friends to do the same. They open a coffee shop on wheels. It’s a terrible idea, but maybe that’s the point.</p>
    <p><i>Lake-Effect Coffee</i> is a self-aware, funny, and off-kilter novella about disillusionment, authenticity, and the strange optimism that blooms when you stop pretending things are fine.</p>
    <p>With a style somewhere between literary fiction and workplace satire, this is a story for anyone who’s ever felt adrift—and wondered if that might actually be the beginning.</p>
