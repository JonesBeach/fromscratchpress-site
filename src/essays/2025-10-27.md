I can’t really debrief my business or newsletter or public life experiments in isolation, so here’s a list instead:

- I wrote a book! I didn’t expect to write a book.
- I spent 21 days in a Leeds pub! I didn’t expect to spend 21 days in a Leeds pub.
- I have control over my brain most of the time, which was the #1 thing I was seeking when I left my 9-5.
- The hardest part has been consistently sharing my work, and finding ways to do so where I don’t lose myself in the process.
- I had to relearn how to go outside, then figure out who I wanted to see once I got there. Somewhere along the way, I started finding the kind of neighborhood I want to stay in.
- I want to keep doing this. It still feels like an experiment worth running.
- I stopped describing my work as “I teach people to code online” and began saying “I started my own business.” My preferred style remains understated and 110% accurate, but a little intrigue doesn’t hurt.
- I didn’t keep Britain in moderation and failed to launch a walking tour.
- I’m proud of nearly all of my clients. One was annoying.
- One-on-one conversations are where I communicate, but I can tolerate certain [in-person] groups if they help me find more of those [1:1 conversations]. It helps when these groups are welcoming by default.
