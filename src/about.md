Hey, I’m [Tyler](https://tyleragreen.com/). I’m a software engineer and writer. I write about neurodivergence, self-employment, and, basically, figuring out how to build a life that fits.

From Scratch Press is where I share essays about my inner life, meaningful work, and the absurdity of it all. If that resonates, you can [subscribe here](/subscribe/).

If you’re into software, I also write and offer personalized mentorship at [From Scratch Code](https://fromscratchcode.com).
