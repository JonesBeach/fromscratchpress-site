Hey, I’m [Tyler]({{ site.personalUrl }}). I’m a software engineer, technical mentor, and writer.

I write about neurodivergence, meaningful work, and figuring out how to build a life that fits—hopefully in a ridiculous way.

From Scratch Press is where I share essays about my inner life, self-employment, and the absurdity of it all. If that resonates, you can [subscribe here]({{ site.subscribeUrl }}).

I write and offer personalized mentorship at [From Scratch Code]({{ site.codeUrl }}).

You may know me as Jones Beach—a place in New York I've never been—on [Substack]({{ site.substackProfileUrl }}) and [GitHub]({{ site.fromScratchGithubUrl }}).

## Want a site like this?

I built this from scratch using [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), and the source is available [on GitHub]({{ site.repoUrl }}). I’m available for freelance work if you need help setting up your own. I’d be happy to help you take control of your web traffic without disrupting your Substack.

[Reach out here]({{ site.contactUrl }}) for rates and availability.
