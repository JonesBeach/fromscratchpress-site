Feel free to call me Jones, JB, or Mr. Beach—all represent a pseudonym I would not respond to if used on the street.

I was diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder Level 1, formerly known as Asperger’s Syndrome, in January 2023. Since then, I have consumed dozens of memoirs, podcasts, and YouTube Video Logs, searching for bits and pieces of my experience told through the lives of others. In this space, I attempt to add my own spin to that canon of misunderstanding, albeit in a semi-anonymous and absurd way.

In addition to writing, I mentor software engineers in a fun and supportive environment—whether they're looking to deepen their skills or navigate their career paths. Code is another of my creative pursuits and I believe it needs a human touch. You can find my technical work at [From Scratch Code](https://fromscratchcode.com/). If you or someone you know is interested in advancing their development skills, I’d love to help them along the way.
